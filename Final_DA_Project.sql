-- âœ… STEP 1: Create Raw Events Table and Load Data
-- Assumes raw CSV is imported already OR use the following query:

LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/raw_events.csv'
INTO TABLE raw_events
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(event_time, event_type, product_id, category_id, category_code, brand, price, user_id, user_session);


-- âœ… STEP 2: Clean the raw_events data
-- Remove nulls and irrelevant event types
CREATE TABLE clean_events AS
SELECT *
FROM raw_events
WHERE event_type IN ('view', 'cart', 'purchase', 'return')
  AND user_id IS NOT NULL
  AND product_id IS NOT NULL;


-- âœ… STEP 3: Create Dimension Tables

-- ðŸŽ¯ dim_users
CREATE TABLE dim_users (
  user_key INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO dim_users (user_id)
SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM clean_events;

-- ðŸŽ¯ dim_products

  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  UNIQUE(product_id, brand, price)
);

INSERT INTO dim_products (product_id, brand, price)
SELECT DISTINCT product_id, brand, price
FROM clean_events;

-- ðŸŽ¯ dim_category

);

INSERT INTO dim_category (category_code)
SELECT DISTINCT category_code
FROM clean_events;

-- ðŸŽ¯ dim_sessions
CREATE TABLE dim_sessions (
  session_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO dim_sessions (session_id)
SELECT DISTINCT user_session FROM clean_events;

-- ðŸŽ¯ dim_date
CREATE TABLE dim_date (
  date_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  full_date DATE,
  year INT,
  month INT,
  day INT,
  week INT,
  weekday VARCHAR(15),
  weekend_flag BOOLEAN,
  UNIQUE(full_date)
);

INSERT INTO dim_date (full_date, year, month, day, week, weekday, weekend_flag)
SELECT DISTINCT

  WEEK(event_time),
  DAYNAME(event_time),
  CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(event_time) IN (1,7) THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END
FROM clean_events;


-- âœ… STEP 4: Create Fact Table
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (

  product_key INT,
  category_id INT,
  session_id VARCHAR(255),
  date_id INT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2),

);

-- Insert only 'purchase' and 'return' records into fact_sales
INSERT INTO fact_sales (user_id, product_key, category_id, session_id, date_id, price, event_type)
SELECT

JOIN dim_sessions ds ON ce.user_session = ds.session_id
JOIN dim_date dd ON DATE(ce.event_time) = dd.full_date
WHERE ce.event_type IN ('purchase', 'return');


-- âœ… STEP 5: Add Foreign Keys to fact_sales
ALTER TABLE fact_sales
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES dim_users(user_id),
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product FOREIGN KEY (product_key) REFERENCES dim_products(product_key),
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_category FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES dim_category(category_id),
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_session FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES dim_sessions(session_id),
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_date FOREIGN KEY (date_id) REFERENCES dim_date(date_id);


-- âœ… STEP 6: Data Quality Checks


-- 6.1 â€“ Check for NULLs in fact_sales
-- Make sure no important foreign keys are missing:

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  SUM(CASE WHEN user_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_users,
  SUM(CASE WHEN product_key IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_products,
  SUM(CASE WHEN category_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_categories,
  SUM(CASE WHEN session_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_sessions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN date_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_dates,
  SUM(CASE WHEN price IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_prices,
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_event_types
FROM fact_sales;


-- ðŸ§© 6.2 â€“ Check for Orphan Keys (Foreign Keys that Donâ€™t Exist in Dimensions)
-- Example: Users in fact_sales not in dim_users


SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fact_sales fs
LEFT JOIN dim_users du ON fs.user_id = du.user_id
WHERE du.user_id IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*)

WHERE ds.user_session IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fact_sales fs
LEFT JOIN dim_date dd ON fs.date_id = dd.date_id
